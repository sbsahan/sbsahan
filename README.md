# Hello! Hi! Welcome! 👋

I'm a self-taught dev from Turkey. I enjoy anything computing or robotics-related! 

## 🚀 Things I'm working on:
- **FRC**: Lead Programmer
- **Didj hacking**: One day I'll be done with this  
- **Working with datasets**: Messing around with IBB/TUIK datasets. Huge enjoyer of public transportation! (IBB I'm begging please add real-time info)  
- **Gopher protocol advocate**: Simplicity goes hard.
